NOTCH
=====

Feed-forward Neural Networks in C++11 for the rest of us.

This is (supposed to be)

 * a header-only C++11 library

 * without extra dependencies (CBLAS dependency is optional)

 * cross-platform (Linux and Windows)

 * reasonably fast (for a CPU-only implementations, HOPEFULLY)

 * but not at the cost of algorithms' readability and portability

This library is named after Notch, a transmembrane protein which acts as a
receptor and has a role, amonth other things, in neuronal function and
development.

Motivation
----------

 * Most of the neural network frameworks are notoriously difficult to
   install and deploy.

   Some of them work only on a particular operating system flavor,
   or have very specific hardware requirements.

   Notch is supposed to lower the barrier to entry and be a tool which
   works anywhere where a modern C++ compiler is available.
   Just copy a header file. No need to install anything.

 * Many neural network frameworks are designed to _train_ neural
   networks. Few care about _using_ them and integrating with end-user
   software.

   Notch is designed to be embedded into other software.


How to use
----------
