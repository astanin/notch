NOTCH
=====

A C++11 implementation of the selected Neural Network algorithms from
"Neural Networks and Learning Machines, 3rd Ed."
([libgen](http://libgen.org/book/index.php?md5=0239f16656e6e5e7db7aaa160cf9f854),
 [amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Neural-Networks-Learning-Machines-3rd/dp/8120340000/))

This is (supposed to be)

 * a header-only C++11 library

 * without extra dependencies

 * cross-platform (runs on Linux and Windows)

 * reasonably fast (for a CPU-only implementations, TODO)

 * but not at the cost of algorithms' readability and portability

This library is named after Notch, a transmembrane protein which acts as a
receptor and has a role, amonth other things, in neuronal function and
development.



Framework
---------

// TO BE WRITTEN


Chapter 1. Rosenblatt's Perceptron
----------------------------------

`LinearPerceptron` class implements a stand-alone perceptron for linear
classification.

There're two training methods:

 * Perceptron convergence algorithm (`trainConverge()`)

 * Perceptron batch training algorithm (`trainBatch()`)

Training data can be generated by `gen_twomoons`.

Demo: `demo_perceptron.cc`


Chapter 4. Multilayer Perceptrons
---------------------------------

`BidirectionalNeuron` implements a neuron which can back-propagate error signal.

`FullyConnectedLayer` is a layer which connects all neurons to all inputs.

`MultilayerPerceptron` is a feed-forward neural network composed of several
`FullyConnectedLayer`s stacked one upon another.

Demo: `demo_multilayer.cc`


How to build
------------


### On Linux

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```


### On Windows

Install MinGW and CMake:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake.exe -G "MinGW Makefiles" .`
mingw32-make
```

For a debug build use

```
cmake.exe -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
```
