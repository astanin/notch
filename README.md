Method Examples for Neural Networks and Learning Machines 3rd Ed.
=================================================================

"Learning through doing".
C++11 implementation of the selected algorithms from
"Neural Networks and Learning Machines, 3rd Ed."


Chapter 1. Rosenblatt's Perceptron
----------------------------------

Implemetation: `perceptron.hh`

Two training methods:

 * perceptron convergence training (`Perceptron::trainConverge()`)
 * batch training on misclassified subsets (`Perceptron::trainBatch()`)

Demo: `demo_perceptron.cc`

Training data can be generated by `gen_twomoons`.


How to build
------------

### On Windows

  * Install MinGW and CMake
  * `mkdir build`
  * `cd build`
  * `cmake.exe -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..`

    or

    `cmake.exe -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..`

  * `mingw32-make`
