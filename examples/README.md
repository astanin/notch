Notch Examples
==============

 * `demo_perceptron` uses a single Rosenblatt's Perceptron to
   classify two linearly separable sets (two moons problem);
   training and test sets can be generated by `gen_twomoons` program

 * `demo_multilayer_xor` creates a multilayer peceptron and trains
   it to calculate XOR function (classify two linearly inseparable sets)

 * `demo_multilayer_iris` trains a multilayer perceptron to classify
    the iris flower dataset; the demo uses some optional Notch features:
    it reads data from a CSV file and applies one-hot encoding to labels
